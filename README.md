# Weather forecast for 15 days from now
The API provides historical data only for the last 7 days.
Another API could be used to get data with historical weather statistics for the previous years, and estimate to have their average as a probable weather
Another method could be, that tomorrow's weather will be most probably like today's weather, therefore the forecast for 7 days from now has a quite good chance to predict the weather for 15 days from now
